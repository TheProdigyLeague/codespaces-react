## üöÄ Introduction for New Users

### **JavaScript**
JavaScript is the language of the web. It allows you to create interactive, dynamic websites and is supported by all modern browsers.

### **Node.js**
Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server, enabling full-stack development with a single language. It‚Äôs fast, scalable, and widely used for backend services and tooling.

### **NPM (Node Package Manager)**
NPM is the default package manager for Node.js. It helps you install, manage, and share reusable code packages (libraries and tools) for your projects.

### **React**
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you create reusable components and efficiently update your web pages as data changes.

  Integrate with GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or other CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment.

- **Hosting:**  
  Deploy your app to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify, Azure Static Web Apps, or your own cloud infrastructure.
